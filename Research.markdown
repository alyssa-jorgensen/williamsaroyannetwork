<p>The William Saroyan Epistolary Ego network works to situate William Saroyan within a larger network of writers.</p>

<p>The motivation for doing so resides in the fact that Saroyan was notably popular in his time yet has faded into relative obscurity. However Saroyan was notably influential to now canonized authors. Jack Kerouac claims in an interview with Ted Berrigan that William Saroyan was who got him out of his "19th century rut" (378). Kerouac even referenced Saroyan in his posthumously published novel <em>And the Hippos were Boiled in their Tanks</em> co-written with William Burroughs and originally written during WWII. In that novella, Kerouac is likely alluding to the short story "Among the Lost" from Saroyan's collection <em>The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze</em> (1934). Collecting data for the network began as a search to see how far Saroyan's influence spread using letters as a material data point to demonstrate how aware Saroyan's contemporaries were of his work.</p>

<p>Thus, the data set mostly consists of writers. Network analysis between writers is particularly interesting as writers typically gain widespread recognition through networks with other writers. The Modernists of the early 20th century frequently formed writer groups and movements and published eachother through "Little Magazines." These writers frequently met in Paris salons and participated in a bohemian lifestyle. The Beat Generation of the 50s and 60s is a subsequent movement coming off of Modernism which also comprised of a network of writers (of which Kerouac, Burroughs, and Ginsberg may be considered central nodes). Saroyan's most popular work predominanlty came out in the 30s and 40s placing him in the middle of major movements and thus possibly forming a sort of tie between such movements.</p>

<p>This network demonstrates that correspondance exists between Saroyan and major modernist writers such as T.S. Eliot, Sherwood Anderson, John Steinbeck, Gertrude Stein, and Thomas Wolfe. This network demonstrates that correspondance exists between Saroyan and Beat authors such as Terry Southern, Seymour Krim, and Ken Kesey.Saroyan has even corresponded with notable science fiction authors H.G. Wells, Ray Bradbury, and Frank Herbert. I believe the network demonstrates Saroyan's wide range of correspondance.</p>

<p>William Saroyan claims he wrote at least 50,000 letters in his lifetime, so the network we have here is remarkably incomplete (Hamalian 20). In fact given Saroyan’s propensity to write letters it is extremely likely that many of the correspondances which seem to be one-sided are in fact incomplete. To take the example of George Bernard Shaw, William Saroyan notes in an interview with Garig Basmadjian that he “loved” George Bernard Shaw’s <em>The Prefaces</em>: “I loved Shaw, George Bernard, <em>The Prefaces</em>” is his exact transcribed quote (144–145). I assume it would be unlikely that Saroyan never wrote back to Shaw.</p>


 Given that the network is currently very limited in its data, I believe looking into archives of other author would lend to more data and evenmore interesting insights. My suggestion is to begin with George Bernard Shaw for reasons stated above. I would also suggest looking more into Jack Kerouac who is currently not in the network, but I find it unlikely the two would have never corresponded even if it is simply one letter from Kerouac. Aram Saroyan even accompanied Kerouac in his interview with Ted Berrigan as a friend so Kerouac was in touch with the family.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I think looking into the Beats in general would be worth it to fill out this network and gain a better understanding of Saroyan's relationship to the movement. Edward Halsey Foster claims that the connection between Saroyan and the beats “needs to be underscored as one of the truly significant lines of influence in American Literary History of our time” (45). Saroyan, though never a beat author, appears to be closely related to the movement through his influence. While the network only appears to show data from three beat authors and Lawrence Ferlinghetti who co-founded the famous City Lights book store and published several beat writers but does not consider himself a beat (Gold). I believe expanding into the archives of various other beat authors may further illuminate Saroyan's relationship to the generation. Particularly as the network actually shows very little correspondance between Saroyan and these authors--Seymour Krim being the only one shown to have corresponded with Saroyan quite frequently. While this may be due to Saroyan writing very infrequently to beat writers, it may also be because the data is missing at the moment.</p>
