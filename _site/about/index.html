  <p>This site hosts an epistolary Ego Network of William Saroyan's correspondances with other writers. Two additional data visualizations are provided providing more data on the contents shown in the network.</p>

<p>In locating data for this network, the guide from <em>California Archive Online</em>'s guide to <em>The Williams Saroyan Papers</em> at Stanford University was a useful starting point for collecting data. Published books of letters accessed through Virginia Libraries and searched for in Google Books (though no publically available letters were found through google books) served to help locate some sample letters from Saroyan.</p>

<p>Data for the network therefore is predominantly derived from the collection <em>William Saroyan Papers</em>at Standford University. The collection is not digitally archived but a guide is available at the Online Archive of California. An additional letter to Henry Miller is included in the data which was published in <em>William Saroyan: The Man Remembered</em> edited by Leo Hamalian. Two additional letters from Tennessee Williams are also included, each of which were published in his collection of letters edited by Albert J. Delvin and Nancy M. Tischler originally from the <em>Fred W. Todd Tennessee Williams Collection</em>. One letter published in that same collection was from a private collection. It as not included as an extra data point to account for the possibility that it may have been donated at some point or another to the <em>William Saroyan Papers</em> and thus is the same 1941 letter already included in the data.</p>
<p>. 25 additional letters are included from Saroyan to Grace Stone Coates and 11 additional letters were included from Grace Stone Coates to Saroyan, all of which were found in the collection of letters edited by Lee Rostad titled <em>Grace Stone Coates: Her Life in Letters</em>In total this network consists of 540 correspondances–135 of which are from Saroyan (out of an alleged at least 50,000 letters written). Aram Saroyan, William Saroyan’s son, was excluded from the data collected because he was an outlier.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>This site contains some sample letters. Additional data on where letters were sent from and specific dates letters were written were derived from these letters and included on the excel sheet. However, because the letters are not digitally archived, I currently do not have the capabilities to go to Stanford, and Saroyan's letters are rarely publisehd in collections, there is a very limited amount of sample texts. The exception is Grace Stone Coates' collection of letters edited by Lee Rostad, some of which are from the William Saroyan Papers at Stanford. I am also currently waiting to recieve volumes 7 and 8 of T.S. Eliot's letters who published Saroyan to see if more sample letters may be found from there. These are currently unavailable at the moment</p>

<p>This epistolary network focuses on writers specifically. The relevant data provided by Online Archive of California included data on who Saroyan wrote to, how many letters Saroyan either sent or revieved, and a date range of when the letters were sent and on the amount of letters sent. This data was uploaded into an excel sheet. Unfortunately because dates were not available for each available letter some of that data is missing. Due to these limitations only "to"/"from" data was used to create the network and other data visualizations. Ideally in the future, if more metadata is included, more can be demonstratesd about Saroyan's letter writing across time and space.</p>

<p> Excluded from the data due to lack of correspondance from Saroyan though still relevant to note are numorous letters I came across from canon authors discussing William Saroyan and his work</p>

<p>Texts were scanned on my iPhone using ScannerPro. The network was created in Cytoscape. The data visualizations were created in RAWGraphs</p>

<h2>Future Directions</h2>
<p>Given the network's limited data it would be worth expanding into the archives of writers Saroyan is likely to have corresponded more with to expand the data.</p>
<p> I would also like for the network to be interactive with attach links and sample letters similar to the [1]: "https://linkedjazz.org/network/ "LinkedJazz"/p&gt; 


<h1>Research</h1>
<p>The William Saroyan Epistolary Ego network works to situate William Saroyan within a larger network of writers.</p>

<p>The motivation for doing so resides in the fact that Saroyan was notably popular in his time yet has faded into relative obscurity. However Saroyan was notably influential to now canonized authors. Jack Kerouac claims in an interview with Aram Saroyan that William Saroyan was who got him out of the 19th century. Kerouac even referenced Saroyan in his posthumously published novel <em>And the Hippos were Boiled in their Tanks</em> co-written with William Burroughs and originally written during WWII. In that novella, Kerouac is likely alluding to the short story "Among the Lost" from Saroyan's collection <em>The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze</em>. Collecting data for the network began as a search to see how far Saroyan's influence spread using letters as a material data point to demonstrate how aware Saroyan's contemporaries were of his work.</p>

<p>Thus, the data set mostly consists of writers. Network analysis between writers is particularly interesting as writers typically gain widespread recognition through networks with other writers. The Modernists of the early 20th century frequently formed writer groups and movements and published eachoterh through "Little Magazines." These writers frequently met in Paris salons and participated in a bohemian lifestyle. The Beat Generation of the 50s and 60s is a subsequent movement coming off of Modernism which also comprised of a network of writers (of which Kerouac, Burroughs, and Ginsberg may be considered central nodes). Saroyan's most popular work predominanlty came out in the 30s and 40s placing him in the middle of major movements and thus possibly forming a sort of tie between such movements.</p>

<p>This network demonstrates that correspondance exists between Saroyan and major modernist writers such as T.S. Eliot, Sherwood Anderson, John Steinbeck, Gertrude Stein, and Thomas Wolfe. This network demonstrates that correspondance exists between Saroyan and Beat authors such as Terry Southern, Seymour Krim, and Ken Kesey.Saroyan has even corresponded with notable science fiction authors H.G. Wells, Ray Bradbury, and Frank Herbert.</p>

<p>I believe the network demonstrates Saroyan's wide range of correspondance. Given that the network is currently very limited in its data, I believe looking into archives of other author would lend to more data and evenmore interesting insights. My suggestion is to begin with Jack Kerouac who is currently not in the network but I find it unlikely the two would have never corresponded even if it is simply one letter from Kerouac. Aram Saroyan even accompanied Kerouac in his interview with Ted Berrigan as part of the <em>Writers at Work</em> series.</p>

<p>Edward Halsey Foster claims that the connection between Saroyan and the beats “needs to be underscored as one of the truly significant lines of influence in American Literary History of our time” (45). Saroyan, though never a beat author, appears to be closely related to the movement through his influence. While the network only appears to show data from three beat authors and Lawrence Ferlinghetti who co-founded the famous City Lights book store and published several beat writers, I believe expanding into the archives of various other beat authors may further illuminate Saroyan's relationship to the generation.</p>
