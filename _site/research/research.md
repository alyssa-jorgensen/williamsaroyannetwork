<p>The William Saroyan Epistolary Ego network works to situate William Saroyan within a larger network of writers.</p>

<p>The motivation for doing so resides in the fact that Saroyan was notably popular in his time yet has faded into relative obscurity. However Saroyan was notably influential to now canonized authors. Jack Kerouac claims in an interview with Aram Saroyan that William Saroyan was who got him out of the 19th century. Kerouac even referenced Saroyan in his posthumously published novel <em>And the Hippos were Boiled in their Tanks</em> co-written with William Burroughs and originally written during WWII. In that novella, Kerouac is likely alluding to the short story "Among the Lost" from Saroyan's collection <em>The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze</em>. Collecting data for the network began as a search to see how far Saroyan's influence spread using letters as a material data point to demonstrate how aware Saroyan's contemporaries were of his work.</p>

<p>Thus, the data set mostly consists of writers. Network analysis between writers is particularly interesting as writers typically gain widespread recognition through networks with other writers. The Modernists of the early 20th century frequently formed writer groups and movements and published eachoterh through "Little Magazines." These writers frequently met in Paris salons and participated in a bohemian lifestyle. The Beat Generation of the 50s and 60s is a subsequent movement coming off of Modernism which also comprised of a network of writers (of which Kerouac, Burroughs, and Ginsberg may be considered central nodes). Saroyan's most popular work predominanlty came out in the 30s and 40s placing him in the middle of major movements and thus possibly forming a sort of tie between such movements.</p>

<p>This network demonstrates that correspondance exists between Saroyan and major modernist writers such as T.S. Eliot, Sherwood Anderson, John Steinbeck, Gertrude Stein, and Thomas Wolfe. This network demonstrates that correspondance exists between Saroyan and Beat authors such as Terry Southern, Seymour Krim, and Ken Kesey.Saroyan has even corresponded with notable science fiction authors H.G. Wells, Ray Bradbury, and Frank Herbert.</p>

<p>I believe the network demonstrates Saroyan's wide range of correspondance. Given that the network is currently very limited in its data, I believe looking into archives of other author would lend to more data and evenmore interesting insights. My suggestion is to begin with Jack Kerouac who is currently not in the network but I find it unlikely the two would have never corresponded even if it is simply one letter from Kerouac.</p>

<p>Edward Halsey Foster claims that the connection between Saroyan and the beats “needs to be underscored as one of the truly significant lines of influence in American Literary History of our time” (45). Saroyan, though never a beat author, appears to be closely related to the movement through his influence. While the network only appears to show data from three beat authors and Lawrence Ferlinghetti who co-founded the famous City Lights book store and published several beat writers, I believe expanding into the archives of various other beat authors may further illuminate Saroyan's relationship to the generation.</p>
