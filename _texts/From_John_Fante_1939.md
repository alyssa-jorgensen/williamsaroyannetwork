Dear Tiger Saroyan, Wildcat Willie the Wow:
</p>

<p>Joyce and I and a whole slew of people will be in Frisco Friday nightaround 8:30 at the Empire Hotel, wherever that is, and Joyce and I look forward with great eagerness to seeing you again.</p>

<p>
Seems Carey McWilliams has just been appointed new Commissioner of Housing and Immigration, a very sweet and interesting job having to do with migratory workers, etc., and we plan to get together at the Empire Hotel, where he is staying, and whence he shall arrive from Sacramento sometime Thursday. You know Carey, Bill. I took you up to his office that time we went downtown in LA. He knows you,your writings, likes you, etc. You might look him up if you like before we arrive at either the hotel or the office of Housing and Immigraton in the State Bldg. In fact, be a good idea: you could get drunk.
</P>

<p>
Anyway we, Joyce and I, want very much to see you Friday night around ate-thirty (8:30) at Empire Hotel. I've written Joe Jackson, telling him I would get in touch with him through you; but I'm writing you now because you told me you no longer had a phone. How come you don't have a phone, you, one of the wealthiest authors on the Pacific Coast, wealthier than the Norrises, the Dobies, the Steinbecks? How come? What do you do with your money? You can explain the whole thing when we meet, and please don't fail us, Willie. We wnt you.
