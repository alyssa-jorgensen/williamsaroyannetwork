DearMr. L note Saroyan: what you say about your aspiration to edit a magazine. I am
sendingyouby this mail a six-chambered revolver. Load it and fire every one
head. You will thank me after you get to Hell and learn from other
dreadtul their job was on earth. I wouldn't go back to magazine
editingfor all the money wasted by the Brain Trust.
Your planseems amusing and if anything decent occurs to me I"'ll certalnlygetit on paper and send it to you. I suggest writing to Cabell and Dreiser
direct and at once. I seldom see either of them. O'Neill I never see at all.
Hergesheimer,at the moment, is in Nassau, but a letter addressed to him at
WestChester,Pennsylvania, will probably be forwarded.
Theproletarianbrethren will probably respond eagerly, so you'll have to
becarefulto avoid getting too many of them into the book. I don't promise
categoricallyto do something, for a suitable idea may not occur to me, but if
onepops up I'll certainly work it out.
WheneverI read anything about myself it always makes me laugh. l am
Constantlycredited with motives that I never had and accused of enterprises
thathavebeen as far from my thoughts as preaching the gospel.
Yours,
(Signed) H.L. Mencken
