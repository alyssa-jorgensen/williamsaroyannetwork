<p>Data was collected on William Saroyan's epistolary correspondances in order to host an ego network that would ideally help situated Saroyan's significance to 20th century literature. The ego network is not fully published yet, but can still be seen in a much less readeable format on the front page in figure 1. Figures 2 an 3 are available to visualize Saroyan's epistolary correspondances using the same data in bar graph format. Figure 2 depicts the number of letters Saroyan sent to each writer in the network. Figure 3 depicts the number of letters sent to Saroyan from other each writer in the network.</p>

<p>In locating data for this network, the guide from <a href="https://oac.cdlib.org/view?docId=tf187001q3&view=dsc&style=oac4&dsc.position=1">Online Archive of California's</a> guide to the <em> Williams Saroyan Papers, 1926-1981</em> at Stanford University was a useful starting point for collecting data. Published books of letters accessed through Virginia Libraries and searched for in Google Books served to help locate some sample letters from Saroyan (though no publically available letters were found through google books; a letter from Theodore Dreiser to Saroyan was available with purchase and will be available in the site's bibliography).</p>

<p>Some extra data was included in the network not located in the Archive. This data was only counteda s extra data if it's clear it was not found or currently available in the <em>William Saroyan Papers</em>. An additional letter to Henry Miller is included in the data which was published in <em>William Saroyan: The Man The Writer Remembered</em> edited by Leo Hamalian. Two additional letters from Tennessee Williams are also included, each of which were published in a collection of his letters edited by Albert J. Delvin and Nancy M. Tischler. These letters were originally from the <em><a href="https://www.hnoc.org/research/fred-w-todd-tennessee-williams-collection-mss-562-correspondence">Fred W. Todd Tennessee Williams Collection</a></em>. One letter published in that same collection by Devin and Tischler was from a private collection. It was not included as an extra data point to account for the possibility that it may have been donated at some point or another to the <em>William Saroyan Papers</em> and thus is possibly the same 1941 letter already included in the data. 25 additional letters are included from Saroyan to Grace Stone Coates and 11 additional letters were included from Grace Stone Coates to Saroyan, all of which were found in the collection of letters edited by Lee Rostad titled <em>Grace Stone Coates: Her Life in Letters</em>.The guide to <em>The William Saroyan Papers</em> only includes 11 letters from Coates to Saroyan so any additionaly letters in the collection were counted as extra and included in the data.</p> 

<p>In total this network consists of 540 correspondances--135 of which are from Saroyan (out of an alleged at least 50,000 letters written). Aram Saroyan, William Saroyan's son, though a writer, was excluded from the data collected because he was an outlier.</p>

<p>This site contains some sample letters from writers like Tennessee Williams, Grace Stone Coates, H.L. Mencken, John Fante, and one to Henry Miller. I currently waiting to recieve volumes 7 and 8 of T.S. Eliot's letters who published Saroyan to see if more sample letters may be found from there. The <em>William Saroyan Papers</em> are not digitally archived so samples could not be derived from the archive. 

<p>Additionally, because the <em>William Saroyan Papers</em> are currently not digitally archived nor can I make it to Stanford at the moment, the kind of data that could be collected from these letters are limited. The relevant data provided by Online Archive of California included who Saroyan wrote to, how many letters Saroyan either sent or revieved, and a date range of when the letters were sent. Unfortunately, because dates were not available for each available letter some of that data is missing for most entries. More data may be derived from sample letters located such as the precise date and from where the letter was sent, but because sample letters are har to come by most entries lack this specificity. Due to these limitations only "to"/"from" data was used to create the network and figures 2 and 3. The focus of this research is therefore more to get a sense of who Saroyan wrote to and often he corresponded with each writer. Ideally in the future, if more metadata is included, more can be learned about Saroyan's letter writing across time and space.</p>

<p>Sample letters were scanned on my iPhone using ScannerPro. The network was created in Cytoscape. The data visualizations were created in RAWGraphs</p>




<h1>Research</h1>
<p>The William Saroyan Epistolary Ego network works to situate William Saroyan within a larger network of writers.</p>

<p>The motivation for doing so resides in the fact that Saroyan was notably popular in his time yet has faded into relative obscurity. However Saroyan was notably influential to now canonized authors. Jack Kerouac claims in an interview with Ted Berrigan that William Saroyan was who got him out of his "19th century rut" (378). Kerouac even referenced Saroyan in his posthumously published novel <em>And the Hippos were Boiled in their Tanks</em> co-written with William Burroughs and originally written during WWII. In that novella, Kerouac is likely alluding to the short story "Among the Lost" from Saroyan's collection <em>The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze</em> (1934). Collecting data for the network began as a search to see how far Saroyan's influence spread using letters as a material data point to demonstrate how aware Saroyan's contemporaries were of his work.</p>

<p>Thus, the data set mostly consists of writers. Network analysis between writers is particularly interesting as writers typically gain widespread recognition through networks with other writers. The Modernists of the early 20th century frequently formed writer groups and movements and published eachother through "Little Magazines." These writers frequently met in Paris salons and participated in a bohemian lifestyle. The Beat Generation of the 50s and 60s is a subsequent movement coming off of Modernism which also comprised of a network of writers (of which Kerouac, Burroughs, and Ginsberg may be considered central nodes). Saroyan's most popular work predominanlty came out in the 30s and 40s placing him in the middle of major movements and thus possibly forming a sort of tie between such movements.</p>

<p>This network demonstrates that correspondance exists between Saroyan and major modernist writers such as T.S. Eliot, Sherwood Anderson, John Steinbeck, Gertrude Stein, and Thomas Wolfe. This network demonstrates that correspondance exists between Saroyan and Beat authors such as Terry Southern, Seymour Krim, and Ken Kesey.Saroyan has even corresponded with notable science fiction authors H.G. Wells, Ray Bradbury, and Frank Herbert. I believe the network demonstrates Saroyan's wide range of correspondance.</p>

<p>William Saroyan claims he wrote at least 50,000 letters in his lifetime, so the network we have here is remarkably incomplete (Hamalian 20). In fact given Saroyan’s propensity to write letters it is extremely likely that many of the correspondances which seem to be one-sided are in fact incomplete. To take the example of George Bernard Shaw, William Saroyan notes in an interview with Garig Basmadjian that he “loved” George Bernard Shaw’s <em>The Prefaces</em>: “I loved Shaw, George Bernard, <em>The Prefaces</em>” is his exact transcribed quote (144–145). I assume it would be unlikely that Saroyan never wrote back to Shaw.</p>


 Given that the network is currently very limited in its data, I believe looking into archives of other author would lend to more data and evenmore interesting insights. My suggestion is to begin with George Bernard Shaw for reasons stated above. I would also suggest looking more into Jack Kerouac who is currently not in the network, but I find it unlikely the two would have never corresponded even if it is simply one letter from Kerouac. Aram Saroyan even accompanied Kerouac in his interview with Ted Berrigan as a friend so Kerouac was in touch with the family.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I think looking into the Beats in general would be worth it to fill out this network and gain a better understanding of Saroyan's relationship to the movement. Edward Halsey Foster claims that the connection between Saroyan and the beats “needs to be underscored as one of the truly significant lines of influence in American Literary History of our time” (45). Saroyan, though never a beat author, appears to be closely related to the movement through his influence. While the network only appears to show data from three beat authors and Lawrence Ferlinghetti who co-founded the famous City Lights book store and published several beat writers, I believe expanding into the archives of various other beat authors may further illuminate Saroyan's relationship to the generation. Particularly as the network actually shows very little correspondance between Saroyan and these authors--Seymour Krim being the only one shown to have corresponded with Saroyan quite frequently. While this may be due to Saroyan writing very infrequently to beat writers, it may also be because the data is missing at the moment</p>
