<p>This site hosts an epistolary Ego Network of William Saroyan's correspondances with other writers.</p>

<p>In locating data for this network, the guide from <em>California Archive Online</em>'s guide to <em>The Williams Saroyan Papers</em> at Stanford University was a useful starting point for collecting data. Published books of letters accessed through Virginia Libraries and searched for in Google Books (though no publically available letters were found through google books) served to help locate some sample letters from Saroyan.</p>

<p>Data for the network therefore is predominantly derived from the collection <em>William Saroyan Papers</em>at Standford University. The collection is not digitally archived but a guide is available at the Online Archive of California. An additional letter to Henry Miller is included in the data which was published in <em>William Saroyan: The Man Remembered</em> edited by Leo Hamalian. Two additional letters from Tennessee Williams are also included, each of which were published in his collection of letters edited by Albert J. Delvin and Nancy M. Tischler originally from the <em>Fred W. Todd Tennessee Williams Collection</em>. One letter published in that same collection was from a private collection. It as not included as an extra data point to account for the possibility that it may have been donated at some point or another to the <em>William Saroyan Papers</em> and thus is the same 1941 letter already included in the data.</p>. In total this network consists of 530 correspondances--123 of which are from Saroyan (out of an alleged at least 50,000 letters written). Aram Saroyan, William Saroyan's son, was excluded from the data collected because he was an outlier.</p>

<p>This site contains some sample letters. Additional sata on where letters were sent from and specific dates letters were written were derived from these letters and included on the excel sheet. However, because the letters are not digitally archived, I currently do not have the capabilities to go to Stanford, and Saroyan's letters are rarely publisehd in collections, there is a very limited amount of sample texts. The exception is Grace Stone Coates' collection of letters edited by Lee Rostad which contains each letter from the William Saroyan Papers at Stanford. I am also currently waiting to recieve volumes 8 and 9 of T.S. Eliot's letters who published Saroyan to see if more sample letters may be found from there. These are currently unavailable at the moment</p> 

<p>This epistolary network focuses on writers specifically. The relevant data provided by Online Archive of California included data on who Saroyan wrote to, how many letters Saroyan either sent or revieved, and a date range of when the letters were sent and on the amount of letters sent. This data was uploaded into an excel sheet. Unfortunately because dates were not available for each available letter some of that data is missing. Due to these limitations only "to"/"from" data was used to create the network and other data visualizations. Ideally in the future, if more metadata is included, more can be demonstratesd about Saroyan's letter writing across time and space.</p>

<p> Excluded from the data due to lack of correspondance from Saroyan though still relevant to note are numorous letters I came across from canon authors discussing William Saroyan and his work</p>

<p>Texts were scanned on my iPhone using ScannerPro. The network was created via Cytoscape. The data visualizations were created in RAWgraphs</p>

<h2>Future Directions</h2>
<p>Given the network's limited data it would be worth expanding into the archives of writers Saroyan is likely to have corresponded more with to expand the data.</p>
<p> I would also like for the network to be interactive with attach links and sample letters similar to the <href a="https://linkedjazz.org/network/"LinkedJazz></p>
