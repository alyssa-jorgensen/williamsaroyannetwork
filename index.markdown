<title>William Saroyan Epistolary Ego Network</title>

<p>This site hosts a visual network on William Saroyan's epistolary correspondances with other writers. Data is predominanlty derived from Data is derived from the collection William Saroyan Papers, 1926-1981 found at Standford University.</p>

<p>William Saroyan claims he wrote at least 50,000 letters in his lifetime, so the network we have here is remarkably incomplete (Hamalian 20). In fact given Saroyan’s propensity to write letters it is extremely likely that many of the correspondances which seem to be one-sided are in fact incomplete. To take the example of George Bernard Shaw, William Saroyan notes in an interview with Garig Basmadjian that he “loved” George Bernard Shaw’s The Prefaces (144 – 145) (“I loved Shaw, George Bernard, The Prefaces” is his exact transcribed quote). I assume it would be unlikely that Saroyan never wrote back to Shaw.</p>


<h1>Who is William Saroyan</h1>
<p>William Saroyan is an Armenian-American playwright and short story writer associated with Bohemianism and San Francisco. He is perhaps best well-know for his short story collection <em>The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze</em> (1934), his play <em>The Time of Your Life</em> (1939), or his novel <em>The Human Comedy</em> (1943). While fairly obscure today William Saroyan was well-known and celebrated amongst his contemporaries, serving as inspiration for quite a few now canonized writers. Beat author Jack Kerouac claims in an interview with Ted Berrigan as part of the series <em>Writers at Work</em> that William Saroyan was who got him out of the 19th century. A few letters from Tennessee Williams written to Saroyan pre-<em>Glass-Menagerie</em>-fame suggest the same.</p>

<p>Leo Hamalian attributes Saroyan's later obscurity to his work being perhaps “strictly ‘California product,’ thus his work did not appeal to the east coast. Hamalian also attributes Saroyan's now obscurity to Saroyan's “ethnic themes” as well as the optimistic slant his work carried during the WWII era as this may have been percieved as Saroyan appealing t0o much to mass public sentiments and thus he fell outside the canon (Hamalian 11 – 2).</P>
